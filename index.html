<h2 id=myHeader>Welcome to Michael's CyberSecurity Blog</h2>
<h2 id=myHeader>Now, it's a little messy around these parts but we're learning!</h2>





<h1>Networking</h1>
<p>Ok! Let's get right into it! I'd like to mention that I already have a full understanding of the difference between TCP(connection-oriented protocol, Transmission Control Protocol) & UDP(connectionless protocol, User Datagram Protocol). I also have dived into three-way handshakes and the different types of networks that there are, but throughout this blog section I will be diving even deeper and posting my experience. Before we dive deeper into the protocols, and types of connections that there are, I am going to list the ports that are most relevant to CyberSecurity.</p> 
<h2>Ports</h2>
<sup>
<p>
http 80 (insecure web server)
</p>
<p>
https 443 (secure web server, encrypted)
</p>
<!--this is my first comment in html-->
<p>
dns 53 (Domain Name Service, it's our lil buddy who holds the weight of our convenience)
</p>

<p>
dhcp 67, 68 (67 is the client requesting an IP, 68 is the dhcp responding to the clients request)
</p>
<p>
rdp 3389 (Remote Desktop Protocol, it's pretty self explainatory but I will be diving deeper into this for my own sake)
</p>
<p style="color:red;">This is my first color test in HTML!!!</p>

<p> I am currently working on Practice Labs provided by SkillSoft, it is 10/30/2020 - 2:19EST & my brain hurts. I can't quit pointing out the fact that there is a lot of information these labs have us skip over, that would be rather nice to know. Anyhow, I am working on Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard & I have just added a server role to the server- "web server" & "ftp access"</p>
